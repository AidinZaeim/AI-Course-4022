## Spam Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Introduction

Spam detection is a critical task in managing and securing communication channels. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). This document outlines the process of building a spam classifier using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with text data preprocessing and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Import Necessary Libraries

We begin by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, text processing, machine learning, and evaluation. This includes pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and several modules from scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. We also use the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) for text preprocessing.

#### Create the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "SMSSpamCollection," which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

#### Encode Labels

We encode the labels to numerical values, where 'ham' is mapped to 0 and 'spam' is mapped to 1. This conversion is necessary for the machine learning algorithms to process the data.

#### Preprocess the Text Data

The text data is preprocessed to standardize and clean the messages. This involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers, tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and lemmatizing the tokens. This step ensures that the text data is in a uniform format, which improves the accuracy of the machine learning model.

#### Split the Data

The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 60-40 ratio. Stratified sampling is used to ensure that both training and testing sets have the same proportion of spam and ham messages as the original dataset.

#### Transform Text Data Using TF-IDF Vectorization

We use TF-IDF vectorization to transform the text data into numerical feature vectors. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus, which helps in capturing the significance of words in the context of the dataset.

#### Train the SVM Model

We train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel on the training data. SVMs are powerful classifiers that work well with high-dimensional data, making them suitable for text classification tasks.

#### Test the Model

The trained SVM model is then used to predict the labels of the test data.

#### Evaluate the Model

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of these metrics for both spam and ham classes.

### Why We Chose This Method and Kernel

The linear kernel was chosen for the SVM because it performs well with linearly separable data, which is often the case in text classification tasks. The simplicity and efficiency of the linear kernel make it a good choice for high-dimensional data such as TF-IDF vectors. Additionally, SVMs are known for their robustness in handling imbalanced datasets, which is a common characteristic of spam detection tasks.

### Functionality and Dataset

The functionality of this project involves preprocessing text data, transforming it using TF-IDF vectorization, training an SVM classifier, and evaluating its performance on detecting spam messages. The dataset used is the "SMSSpamCollection," which contains labeled SMS messages, providing a realistic scenario for developing and testing a spam detection model.
