# Diabetes Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Introduction
Diabetes detection is a crucial task in medical diagnostics. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health metrics. This document outlines the process of building a diabetes classifier using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernel functions and evaluating their performance.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
Import Necessary Libraries
We begin by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and evaluation. This includes pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and several modules from scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

### Create the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "diabetes.csv," which contains various health metrics and an outcome variable indicating the presence of diabetes. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

### Separate Features and Target Variable
We separate the features (input variables) and the target variable (output variable).

### Split the Data
The dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio. Stratified sampling is used to ensure that both training and testing sets have the same proportion of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals as the original dataset.

### Train the SVM Model
We train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with various kernel functions on the training data. SVMs are powerful classifiers that work well with high-dimensional data, making them suitable for medical data classification tasks.

### Test the Model
The trained SVM model is then used to predict the labels of the test data.

### Evaluate the Model
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of these metrics for both diabetic and non-diabetic classes.

### Why We Chose This Method and Kernels
The choice of kernel functions was based on their suitability for handling different data characteristics. The linear kernel was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency with linearly separable data. The RBF and sigmoid kernels were selected for their ability to handle non-linear relationships, while the polynomial kernel was included to capture more complex patterns. SVMs are also robust in handling imbalanced datasets, which is a common characteristic of medical data.

### Functionality and Dataset
The functionality of this project involves preprocessing health data, training an SVM classifier with different kernel functions, and evaluating its performance in detecting diabetes. The dataset used is "diabetes.csv," which contains labeled health metrics providing a realistic scenario for developing and testing a diabetes detection model.
