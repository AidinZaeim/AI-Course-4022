# Health Survey Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Introduction
Health survey data classification is crucial for understanding and predicting health outcomes based on survey responses. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify health survey responses. This document outlines the process of building a classifier using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with data preprocessing and standardization.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
Import Necessary Libraries
We begin by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, machine learning, evaluation, and visualization. This includes pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and several modules from scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

### Create the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "health_survey.csv", which contains various health-related survey responses. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

### Handle Missing Data
Missing data is handled using the SimpleImputer with the 'most_frequent' strategy. This ensures that any missing values are filled with the most frequently occurring value in the respective column.

### Preprocess the Data
To preprocess the data, we:
1. Drop rows with specific values (e.g., HIQ210 == 9.0).
2. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
3. Split the data into training and test sets using a 70-30 ratio.
4. Standardize the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
### Train the SVM Model
We train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with different kernels ('rbf', 'sigmoid', 'linear', 'poly') on the scaled training data. SVMs are powerful classifiers suitable for high-dimensional data.

### Test the Model
The trained SVM models are used to predict the labels of the test data.

### Evaluate the Model
The models' performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, recall, and a detailed classification report. Additionally, a confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's performance.

### Why We Chose This Method and Kernels
Different kernels were chosen for the SVM to evaluate their performance on the health survey classification task. The linear kernel is often a good choice due to its simplicity and efficiency. Other kernels like 'rbf', 'sigmoid', and 'poly' are also evaluated to explore their effectiveness in capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

### Functionality and Dataset
The functionality of this project involves preprocessing health survey data, training SVM classifiers with different kernels, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the classification results. The dataset used is "health_survey.csv," which provides a realistic scenario for developing and testing a health survey classification model.
